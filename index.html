          To spot and fix defects early in the process, enforce coding standards and keep the quality bar up. But also to get a  shared understanding of the code base as team members learn from each other. Code reviews are classless. Even if, in the rare case, the code is flawless, the review provides an opportunity for mentorship and collaboration.

          It is intended to find and fix mistakes overlooked in the initial development phase. So they should happen after automated tests have completed successfully, but before the code merges to the repository’s mainline branch.

          It is common for the committer to propose reviewers who are familiar with the code base. Reviewing code is more of an art than a science. The only way to learn it is to do it; an experienced reviewer should, therefore, consider putting other less experienced to do a review. Code reviews among more than three parties are often unproductive/counter-productive since different reviewers may propose contradictory changes.

          A code review has the potential to block progress. Consequently, team members need to be aware of the time commitment and prioritize review time. For the majority of code reviews tools such as GitHub are a great choice. Complex changes, or reviews between people with very different expertise or experience, can be more efficient when performed in person or in front of the same screen.

          Reviews should be concise and written in neutral language. Be respectful - Critique the code, not the author.  If you can’t come to an agreement with your reviewee, seek a third opinion. <br/> On the other hand: Part of the purpose of the code review is improve the author’s change request. Consequently, don’t be offended by your reviewer’s suggestions and take them seriously even if you don’t agree.
